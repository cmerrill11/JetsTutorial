## Wikipedia:
Method takes random samples _u_ between 0 and 1, interpreted as probability, and returns the largest value _x_ from the domain of the function _P(X)_ such that the probability of drawing _X_ less than or equal to _x_ is equal to _u_.

You randomly choose a portion of area occuring under the curve and then finding the  where this area occurs behind.
